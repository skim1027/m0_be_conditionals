# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
 - When you have a condition that is either true or false. 
2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
 - Although I went through all the code challenges, I recorded myself doing the first one because I wasn't sure if I would be able to record the medium or spicy within 5 minutes. Although it took me a few extra, I think it would've been fun to record the other ones.
3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
 - When I was working on the FizzBuzz challenges, I was pretty comfortable getting the lines set up. However, as I was testing, I realized that the order I had my code wouldn't consider the instances where the number was divisible by 3 & 5 if the condition was met first. I quickly realized that and switched the order of my operation which made the code work. This felt very satisfying to realize what was wrong, and that I was able to quickly update it.
